/*
 * We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach.
 * This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10.
 * If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10
 * (rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1).
 * The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit left.
